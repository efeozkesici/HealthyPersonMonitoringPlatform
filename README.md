Healthy Person Monitoring Platform, which is my graduation project, consists of two main scenarios: mobile and web. 3 people made the project and I developed the mobile application of the project. If I talk about our project, with the help of smart watches found in individuals, it provides individuals with a healthier aging opportunity by collecting pulse, daily step and blood pressure information and facilitating easy communication between the person using the watch and the doctor. Doctors and individuals can communicate easily through the application. When there is a mishap in the information of the individual (sudden blood pressure drop, staying under a certain daily step, etc.), the doctor is notified and the doctor can take care of the individual more closely.
